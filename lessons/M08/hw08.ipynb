    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will write and test a simple class using Python's `unittest` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to develop your ability to create a unit test suite as well as your ability to write classes and use pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `booklover.py` that will contain the class `BookLover`.\n",
    "* `booklover_test.py` that will contain the class `BookLoverTestSuite`.\n",
    "* `booklover_results.txt` that will contain the results of applying the second class to the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create them all in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are not Jupyter Notebooks; you will need to use a text editor to create them. You can use the text editor that comes with Jupyter Lab if you like, or use Visual Studio Code, or whatever suites you."

    "(5 points; .5 pt per attribute and method)\n",

    "Create a BookLover class in a file named `booklover.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "|Attribute | Value |\n",
    "|----------|-------|\n",
    "| `name` | The name of the person (type:string) |\n",
    "| `email` | The person’s email, serving as a unique identifier (type:string) |\n",
    "| `fav_genre` | The person’s favorite book genre (e.g., mystery, fantasy, or historical fiction).  (type:string) |\n",
    "| `num_books` | Keeps track of the number of books the person has read (type:int) |\n",
    "| `book_list` | a dataframe with the columns `['book_name', 'book_rating']`\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in `book_list` have the following meanings:\n",
    "- `book_name` is the title of the book the person has read.\n",
    "- `book_rating` is the person’s rating of that book on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means the person did not like the book at all, and 5 means the person loved the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some example book entries are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(\"Jane Eyre\", 4)\n",
    "(\"Fight Club\", 3)\n",
    "(\"The Divine Comedy\", 5)\n",
    "(\"The Popol Vuh\", 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initializer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__()`:\n",
    "- `name`, `email`, and `fav_genre` (in this order) are required. \n",
    "- `num_books` and `book_list` are optional.\n",
    "- Use these default parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  num_books = 0\n",
    "  book_list = pd.DataFrame({'book_name':[], 'book_rating':[]})\n",
    "```\n",
    "Do not add any additional fields of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_book(book_name, rating)`:\n",
    "- This function takes a `book name` (string) and `rating` (integer from 0 to 5)\n",
    "- It tries to add the book to `book_list`. See hint below on how to pass a new book to the dataframe.\n",
    "- Only add a book to the person’s `book_list` if that book doesn’t already exist.\n",
    "  - It is sufficient to match on `book_name`.\n",
    "- If it does exist, tell the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: To add a new book to the book list (which is a dataframe), do this in your method, where `book_name` and `book_rating` are the arguments passed to the method.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_book = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'book_name': [book_name], \n",
    "    'book_rating': [book_rating]\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "self.book_list = pd.concat([self.book_list, new_book], ignore_index=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, be sure to see if `book_name` is not in the book list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`has_read(book_name)`\n",
    "- This function takes `book_name` (string) as input and determines if the person has read the book.\n",
    "  - That is, if that `book name` is in `book_list`. \n",
    "  - Again, it is sufficient to match on `book_name`.\n",
    "- The method should return `True` if the person has read the book, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`num_books_read()`\n",
    "- This function takes no parameters and just returns the total number of books the person has read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`fav_books()`:\n",
    "- This function takes no parameters and returns the filtered dataframe of the person’s most favorite books. \n",
    "- Books in this list should have a rating > 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Once you have created your class**\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to instantiate your class to see if everything is working. You can do this by prototyping your class in a notebook, where you can run code that uses it there, and then save the class to the `.py` file when you are done. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can create a another file, say `demo.py` that imports and uses the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final option -- which the test file will use -- is to put this code at the bottom of your `.py` file, after and outside of your class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    \n",
    "    test_object = BookLover(\"Han Solo\", \"hsolo@millenniumfalcon.com\", \"scifi\")\n",
    "    test_object.add_book(\"War of the Worlds\", 4)\n",
    "    # And so forth\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The methods listed above do not have `self` as their first argument, but they should in your class."
